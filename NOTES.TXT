Seems to compile but a lot needs to be figured out to get this to be
consistently compileable
edit my_make.bat in root dir with your paths

NEEDED:
- Watcom 10.6
- http://takeda-toshiya.my.coocan.jp/msdos/ for invoking 16 bit TASM
- TASM32 from 4.1 to run on modern Windows, if that doesn't work try even newer, TASM (16 bit must remain 4.0)

NOTES:
- WMAKE copy directive is broken, replaced with -copy forces it to use system's
- Various missing h/cpp files can be found in Remasters repo
- high res vqa is broken currently cause vqa lib code is outdated,
	its likely they kept only a lib up to date, not whole source dir

TODO:
- solve ipxproto ebn dependency or eliminate ipxproto all togther
- investigate getting TASM32 4.0 working
- find solution for mmx.inc
