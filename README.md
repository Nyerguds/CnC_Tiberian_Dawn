# Command & Conquer Patch Project

This repository contains buildable and source code for Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn; the original first Command & Conquer game. It was [provided by Electronic Arts](https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn).

This repository was forked from [a branch made by tomsons26](https://github.com/tomsons26/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn/tree/temp), in which he did out most of the work of figuring out exactly how to set this up to get it building.

The purpose of the Command & Conquer patch project is to fix bugs in the game, and possibly port in some Quality-Of-Life features from the C&C: Remastered source code.

## Compiling and Dependencies

The main game needs the following compilers and tools to function correctly:
